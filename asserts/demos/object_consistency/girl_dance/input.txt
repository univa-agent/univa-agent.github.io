I want to generate a 20-second long video with 4 segments. The main subject of the video is a girl dancing. However, the background of each of the 4 segments needs to be different. I need the first segment to be a cyberpunk background, the second segment to be an aesthetic ink dream, the third segment to be a retro film block, and the fourth segment to be an abstract geometric dynamic. The main subject of the four segments should be consistent and the movements should be coherent. The reference image of the girl is /share/project/liangzy/liangzy2/UniVideo/assets/images/generation/characters/girl_cartoon.png .
